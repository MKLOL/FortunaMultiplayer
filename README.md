Play Chess and Dots with multiplayer support

## How to play:

### Chess:
Go to the piece you want to move with up/down/left/right. Press select on the piece, and then select which square to move on.
While you are hovering over a piece (yours or enemy) you can see what moves it can do.
If you are in chess and are trying to do an invalid move you will be notified.
If you want to resign, press the middle button until you enter the right menu. Select resign.

### Dots:
Go to the line you want to put, and press select to put the line.

## Game select

### Multiplayer
Connect two lafortuna players with rx/tx.
Select the multiplayer game you want to play: either dots or chess
The game will start automaticall on both devices.

### Local multiplayer 

Select the 1v1 version of the game. You will be able to control both players.

### For AI (Only dots).

Select AI version of the dots game, and the second player will be an AI machine.
Even though it's a pretty simple AI, it is better than some I've seen on mobile platforms :).

## Known issues and improvements.

### Issues:

* Chess does not have chess mate, you have to resign.
* Chess does not have the more advanced moves.
* Pawn promotion is automatic to queen
* If you don't have the devices connected always, the games may reach invalid states

### Improvments:
The improvements are partially sorted by how easy they would be
* Add good pawn promotion
* Check for chessmate
* Currently the chess piece textures are a binary matrix, that uses a lot of memory. One solution would be to load from the SD card.
* Chess AI.
